# passwordManager
Simple java hash function integrated with an SQLite server, I made this as a proof of concept hashing algorithm, it hashes passwords of any length 
into a bit string of length 512, it also uses random number generation when the hashes are created so if multiple users had the same
password they will have different hashes.
